# BookLibrary
## Overview
This project concerns a personal library website. The user can search for and store the books they have read from the latest book they have read to the oldest.
The "library shelf" consists of an image of each book cover, along with their title, author's name, year of publication and a review they write upon book submission.
The user can edit their review whenever they like, and they can also delete any entry they want to.
